This page is a tutorial for how to set up a useful readme for your github user.

## Step 0 -- Git Setup

* Install R and RStudio
* Setup up a Github user

## Step 1 -- Create Repo

First you will have to create a repository with the name of the repo the same as your github username.

You can see it's set to public that is needed for everyone to see the repo. And Initialize the repo with a Readme File. 

## Step 2 -- Create Rmd file

There are two different ways to create the Rmd file for this project.

### 2.1 -- Method 1

Top left of R Studio there is a white box with a plus in a green circle. Press that then a popup will show up. Go to templates and scroll till you find the github document template. It will open an untitled file. The file heading will say: 

    `--- 
    title: "Untitled" 
    output: github_document 
    ---`.

Then Change title to your name first and last. (For example if I was John Doe then the title would be 'title: "John Doe"')

Save the file as Readme.Rmd

### 2.2 Method

Top left of R Studio there is a white box with a plus in a green circle. Press that then a popup will show up. Pick any template for this method it doesn't matter. It will open an untitled file. The file heading will say:

    `--- 
    title: "Untitled" 
    output: template_document
    ---`.
    
Rewrite the heading to say:     


    `--- 
    title: "First_name Last_name" 
    output: template_document
    ---`.
    
Save the file as Readme.Rmd

## Step 3 -- Source the R Script

You can source a [R script]() that will have functions useful for the readme file. The command used needs to be created in an R chunk.
